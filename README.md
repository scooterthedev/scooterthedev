### Glad to see you here!  

I am a full-stack software engineer and writer. I love programming,
writing, speaking and traveling.

As a software engineer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail,
my unequivocal love for making things that change the world. That's why
I like to make things that make a difference.

 **Donations:**

​If you think that any of my projects were cool please consider donating. All my apps will be free because I feel that everyone should enjoy a great app for **free**, and not just the people that have the money to pay fopr them. Donating will help me keep these apps free of charge and it helps me a ton with the future development of my new app Talkufy and hopefully amazing future projects.
